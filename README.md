## About

#### What is ICO?

**Initial Coin Offerings**, also known as ICOs is the cryptocurrency version of crowdfunding and are a part of the crypto world that is most likely here to stay. It's one of the easiest and most efficient methods for companies and individuals to fund their projects and for regular users to invest in projects they see value in. An Initial Coin Offering is an event that usually extends over a period of one month or more and in which everyone is allowed to purchase newly issued tokens in exchange for established cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin (BTC) or Ether (ETH).

#### History Of ICO

One of the earliest documented uses of ICOs for a cryptocurrency project was Mastercoin, which was crowdfunded on Bitcointalk forums. Mastercoin is a meta-protocol on top of the Bitcoin blockchain that provides additional features that the base Bitcoin layer doesn’t. The ICO took place during mid-2013. Mastercoin (MSC) raised over 5000 Bitcoin (BTC) at the rate of 100 MSC per BTC sent to an “exodus address” during the ICO phase.

Then, the cryptocurrency project NXT had its own ICO on Bitcointalk forums, raising 21 BTC. NXT created a cryptocurrency coded from scratch (i.e. not a fork of the original Bitcoin code) and implemented the first fully proof-of-stake system. The project was quite successful for the ICO investors, reaching a peak of ‘market capitalization’ of over $100 million, and currently over $10 million. This made it one of the most successful ICOs for investors.

Lastly, Ethereum remains one of the largest ICOs to date, raising over $18 million with a current market capitalization of around $ 1 billion.
